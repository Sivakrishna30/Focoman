# Focoman Agent System Directives

This repository operates under the strict governance of **[Agents.md](Agents.md)**.

All AI coding agents interacting with the Focoman codebase MUST read and strictly adhere to **[Agents.md](Agents.md)** and **[Index.md](docs/Index.md)**.

## Mandatory Workflow

For EVERY user engineering request, agents MUST execute the 4 mandatory phases:

```text
User Request
     ↓
Program Manager (Task Decomposition & Implementation Plan)
     ↓
USER APPROVAL GATE (Explicit approval required before coding)
     ↓
Solution Architect (Technical Blueprint / Solution Guide)
     ↓
Developer (Focused Implementation & Change Log)
     ↓
Testing (Truthful Verification & Real Data Integrity)
```

## Non-Negotiable Core Rules

1. **Plan Before Execute & Explicit User Approval**: Do NOT implement code until an implementation plan has been explicitly approved by the user.
2. **Mandatory 4-Phase Chain**: Developer must NOT bypass Program Manager or Solution Architect stages.
3. **Source of Truth & Documentation Map**: Always consult `docs/Index.md` first to locate authoritative project specifications.
4. **Repository Awareness**: Verify all files, functions, APIs, models, and schemas before assuming existence.
5. **No Hallucination**: Never fabricate requirements, endpoints, schemas, or test results.
6. **No Fake Data / No Silent Fallback**: Mock, dummy, placeholder, or hardcoded substitutes for real data are strictly prohibited. Surface truthful error/unavailable states.
7. **Security & Permissions**: Preserve authorization boundaries. Do not bypass security to simplify implementation.
8. **Change Log**: Every meaningful change must be logged in `CHANGELOG.md`.

Refer to **[Agents.md](Agents.md)** for detailed role prompts, protocols, and definitions of done.
